//! Raw HID mouse **and keyboard** input straight from `/dev/input/event*`, bypassing SDL.
//!
//! **Why.** SDL mouse events on webOS come from the compositor's pointer, smoothed/resampled
//! for a wrist-waved remote rather than a 125–1000 Hz mouse — jittery deltas no matter what the
//! client does with them. evdev is the same bypass aurora-tv ships as "Use Hardware Mouse".
//! Keyboards need the same exclusive grab in **both** cursor modes: an ungrabbled USB/Bluetooth
//! keyboard still reaches surface-manager, which then treats modifier+click as a system gesture,
//! warps its pointer to screen centre on the first typed character, and pops "This app does not
//! support quick control" on a double right-click. The Magic Remote is an absolute-pointer node
//! and is never opened here.
//!
//! **Two cursor modes.** Capture on (games): mouse nodes are grabbed too, SDL relative is off,
//! the compositor pointer is hidden. Capture off (desktop/absolute): mouse nodes are left with
//! the compositor so the TV pointer stays the one you aim — only the keyboard is stolen.
//!
//! **Access.** Unlike `/dev/hidraw*` (jail-blocked, see `dualsense.rs`), evdev nodes are
//! reachable: `root:compositor 0660`, and the app's uid carries gid 505 in its supplementary
//! groups — verified on-device, non-rooted, webOS 10.3.
//!
//! **Grabbed while active.** `EVIOCGRAB` is scoped to [`HidMouse::set_active`], not held for the
//! reader's whole life: `cursor::COMPOSITOR_CURSOR_CONTROL` is verified off on webOS 26 (see
//! `cursor.rs`), so an ungrabbed node leaves the compositor drawing its own pointer from the same
//! evdev reports we forward. Scoping it to "caller wants it" rather than the reader's whole life
//! bounds a wedged thread's blast radius to "no HID input" instead of "no mouse input at all,
//! TV-wide" — the kernel releases the grab the moment our fd closes (including on panic), and the
//! surface-manager's own fd stays open throughout, just starved of events while ours holds it.
//! The Magic Remote never matches the mouse/keyboard filter, so it stays usable via SDL —
//! which is what [`HidMouse::owns_sdl_keys`] is for (drop HID keyboard echoes, keep remote keys).
//!
//! **One flag, two effects.** "Grabbed" and "forwarded to the host" are the same condition by
//! construction, not two atomics a caller has to keep in sync: [`HidMouse::set_active`]`(false)`
//! both releases the node and stops calling `sink`, in one store — needed for the disconnect
//! dialog, which hands the pointer back to the Magic Remote and needs a HID mouse to go quiet for
//! the same window.
